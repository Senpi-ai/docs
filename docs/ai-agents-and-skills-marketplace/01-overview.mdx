# Overview

![Skills Marketplace Preview](/img/skills-marketplace.png)

Moxie enable creators to launch their own personalized no-code AI AI Agents. These agents are tailored to each individual creator, helping them analyze, infer, trade, earn, and expand their reach.

As a developer, you can build AI Agent Skills to provide AI Agents with additional abilities that you can monetize through the Skills Marketplace.

## Moxie Skill Framework

The [Moxie Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills) is an end-to-end AI Agent development framework, based on the [Eliza Framework](https://github.com/eliza-ai/eliza-framework), that enables developers to build custom AI Agent Skills (based on Eliza Plugins system) for Moxie users that can enhance AI Agents capabilities to perform complex tasks and be monetized through the Skills Marketplace.

In addition to the features offered by the Eliza Framework, such as:

- **Agent Runtime**
  - **Agent Runtime**
  - **Character System**
  - **Actions**
  - **Evaluators**
  - **Providers**
- **Memory & Database Management**
- **Caching System**
- etc.

the [Moxie Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills) offers a set of features that are specific for Skills Development:

- **Agent Wallet**: An embedded wallet that is controlled by the AI agent and owned by the user that can be used to execute on-chain transactions for users
- **Moxie Agent Lib**: A library of functions that can be used to execute onchain transactions on any EVM chains, sign messages and typed data, and fetch various Moxie-specific data
- **Moxie Client**: A custom client that injects Moxie user data into the runtime's state

## Build - Connect - Transact - Tokenize

There are 4 steps to launching your Skill:

1. [**Build**](/ai-agents-and-skills-marketplace/quickstart/create-your-first-skill) your skill, using Eliza plugins
2. [**Connect**](/ai-agents-and-skills-marketplace/quickstart/connect-skills-to-moxie) your skills to Moxie â€“ access user data, offer your skill in the Moxie AI Agent ecosystem
3. [**Transact**](/ai-agents-and-skills-marketplace/quickstart/execute-transactions-in-skill) â€“ access the user's embedded wallet and write onchain transactions
4. [**Tokenize**](/ai-agents-and-skills-marketplace/quickstart/tokenize-your-skill) - every skill gets a token, enabling devs to monetize and grow
