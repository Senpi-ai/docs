Moxie enables users to launch their own personalized AI Assistants. These AI Assistants are tailored to each individual user, helping them analyze, infer, trade, and earn. Users customize and add more functionality to their AI Assistants by adding ‚Äúskills.‚Äù

Developers can easily offer skills with open source Eliza plugins integrated into Moxie.
