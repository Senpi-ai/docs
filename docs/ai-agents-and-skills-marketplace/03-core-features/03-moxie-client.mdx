# Moxie Client

The Moxie Client is a specialized Eliza client that extends the `DirectClient` class, serving as the primary interface for users on [moxie.xyz](https://moxie.xyz) to interact with their agents.

One of its key features is the ability to inject authenticated users data into predefined states, enabling developers to access relevant information during Skill development.

In the [Moxie Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills), the Moxie Client does not include an authentication layer for local development purposes. Consequently, the injected states will return mock data instead of real user data.

These states include:

## States

### `agentName`

The `agentName` state contains the name of the agent.

```ts {9}
export default Action {
    handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback?: HandlerCallback
    ): Promise<boolean> => {
        const agentName: string = state.agentName;
    }
}
```

### `moxieUserInfo`

The `moxieUserInfo` state contains the authenticated user's information, including their wallet address, username, and profile image, etc.

```ts {9}
export default Action {
    handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback?: HandlerCallback
    ): Promise<boolean> => {
        const moxieUserInfo: MoxieUser = state.moxieUserInfo;
    }
}
```

### `agentWallet`

The `agentWallet` state contains the user's agent wallet details, including the wallet address.

```ts {9}
export default Action {
    handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback?: HandlerCallback
    ): Promise<boolean> => {
        const agentWallet: MoxieWallet = state.agentWallet;
    }
}
```

### `moxieWalletClient`

The `moxieWalletClient` state is a `MoxieWalletClient` instance that provides methods for interacting with the [user's agent wallet](../03-core-features/01-user-agent-wallet.mdx).

```ts {9}
export default Action {
    handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback?: HandlerCallback
    ): Promise<boolean> => {
        const moxieWalletClient: MoxieWalletClient = state.moxieWalletClient;
    }
}
```

### `currentWalletBalance`

The `currentWalletBalance` state contains the current ERC20 balance of the user's agent wallet.

```ts {9}
export default Action {
    handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback?: HandlerCallback
    ): Promise<boolean> => {
        const currentWalletBalance: string = state.currentWalletBalance;
    }
}
```
