# Overview

The Moxie Auction Subgraph API is now available to index and query data from the Moxie protocol's auction contract on the Base Sepolia testnet. Support for Base mainnet contracts will be coming very soon.

The Moxie Auction Subgraph API provides you with various data points to support various use cases, including but not limited to:

- [All auction bids made by a certain user](./03-users/01-get-users-auction-bids.mdx)
- [All auctions that a user participated in](./03-users/02-get-all-auctions-participated-by-certain-user.mdx)
- [List of all bids in a certain auction](./05-bids/01-get-all-bids-on-certain-auction.mdx)
- [Details of a certain auction](./04-auctions/02-get-details-of-certain-auction.mdx)
- etc.

You can access and test the API through the Subgraph Studio link <Link to={url.auction_subgraphs_legacy}>here</Link>.
