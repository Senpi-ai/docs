# Auction Subgraph Overview

The Moxie Auction Subgraph API is now available to index and query data from the Moxie protocol's auction contract on the Base mainnet.

The Moxie Auction Subgraph API provides you with various data points to support various use cases, including but not limited to:

- [All auction bids made by a certain user](../../use-cases/users/02-get-all-auction-bids-made-by-certain-user.mdx)
- [All auctions that a user participated in](../../use-cases/users/02-get-all-auctions-participated-by-certain-user.mdx)
- [List of all bids in a certain auction](../../use-cases/bids/get-all-bids-registered-on-certain-auction.mdx)
- [Details of a certain auction](../../use-cases/fan-token-auctions/get-details-of-certain-fan-token-auction.mdx)
- etc.

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API is divided into two, the <Link to={`${url.auction_minimal_subgraphs}/graphql`}>Auction Minimal Subgraph</Link> and the <Link to={`${url.auction_stats_subgraphs}/graphql`}>Auction Stats Subrgaph</Link>, and you can access both in the Graph studio.

The Auction Stats Subgraph contains all the APIs available on the Moxie Auction Subgraph API, while the Auction Minimal Subgraph provides a lighter version with only a subset of all the APIs available but a faster syncing time.

The Moxie Auction Subgraph API is free to consume but will be rate-limited. If you need higher throughput for your use case, you can use the network subgraph on the Graph network:

- [Auction Stats Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/BDAX81dfjwhDu71Dhe7qETves9ptQ9xsstFSsuVu1NXn?view=Indexers&chain=arbitrum-one)
- [Auction Minimal Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/HMuQ6NQNRcuK8PrbVD8HEzUxdsAixcwdANLRyvJegR3a?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one)
