# Overview

The Moxie Auction Subgraph API is now available to index and query data from the Moxie protocol's auction contract on the Base Sepolia testnet. Support for Base mainnet contracts will be coming very soon.

The Moxie Auction Subgraph API provides you with various data points to support various use cases, including but not limited to:

- [All auction bids made by a certain user](./03-users/01-get-users-auction-bids.mdx)
- [All auctions that a user participated in](./03-users/02-get-all-auctions-participated-by-certain-user.mdx)
- [List of all bids in a certain auction](./05-bids/01-get-all-bids-on-certain-auction.mdx)
- [Details of a certain auction](./04-auctions/02-get-details-of-certain-auction.mdx)
- etc.

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API is accessible through the Graph studio <Link to={url.auction_stats_subgraphs}>here</Link>.

{/* The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API is divided into two, the <Link to={`${url.auction_transactional_subgraphs}/graphql`}>Auction Transactional Subgraph</Link> and the <Link to={`${url.auction_stats_subgraphs}/graphql`}>Auction Analytics Subrgaph</Link>, and you can access both in the Graph studio. */}

{/* The Auction Analytics Subgraph contains all the APIs available on the Moxie Auction Subgraph API, while the Auction Transactional Subgraph provides a lighter version with only a subset of all the APIs available but a faster syncing time. */}
