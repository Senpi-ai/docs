# Overview

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API is now available to index and query data from the Moxie protocol contracts on the Base Sepolia testnet. Support for Base mainnet contracts will be coming very soon.

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API provides you with various data points to support various use cases, including but not limited to:

- [User's fan token balances](./03-users/01-get-all-fan-tokens-owned-by-users.mdx)
- [Holders of certain fan token](./04-fan-tokens/01-get-holders-of-certain-fan-token.mdx)
- etc.

You can access and test the API through the Subgraph Studio link <Link to={url.protocol_subgraphs_legacy}>here</Link>.
