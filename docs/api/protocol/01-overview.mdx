# Protocol Subgraph Overview

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API is now available to index and query data from the Moxie protocol contracts on the Base mainnet.

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API provides you with various data points to support various use cases, including but not limited to:

- [Trending fan tokens](../../use-cases/fan-tokens/01-get-trending-fan-tokens.mdx)
- [All fan tokens on the Moxie protocol](../../use-cases/fan-tokens/13-get-all-fan-tokens.mdx)
- [User's fan token balances](../../use-cases/users/01-get-all-fan-tokens-owned-by-users.mdx)
- [Holders of certain fan token](../../use-cases/fan-tokens/07-get-holders-of-certain-fan-token.mdx)
- [User's buy orders on the bonding curve](../../use-cases/users/03-get-users-buy-orders.mdx)
- etc.

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API is divided into two, the <Link to={`${url.protocol_minimal_subgraphs}/graphql`}>Protocol Minimal Subgraph</Link> and the <Link to={`${url.protocol_stats_subgraphs}/graphql`}>Protocol Stats Subrgaph</Link>, and you can access both in the Graph studio.

The Protocol Stats Subgraph contains all the APIs available on the Moxie Protocol Subgraph API, while the Protocol Minimal Subgraph provides a lighter version with only a subset of all the APIs available but a faster syncing time.

The Moxie Protocol Subgraph API is free to consume but will be rate-limited. If you need higher throughput for your use case, you can use the network subgraph on the Graph network:

- [Protocol Minimal Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/EXRKnsoBNwWk134nV5aezpZCPwcD6RWRCWMM2S7KXJXe?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one)
