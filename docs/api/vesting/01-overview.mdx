# Overview

The Moxie Vesting Subgraph API is now available to index and query data from the Moxie protocol's vesting contract on the Base Sepolia testnet. Support for Base mainnet contracts will be coming very soon.

The Moxie Vesting Subgraph API provides you with various data points to support various use cases, including but not limited to:

- [List of users with locked Moxie tokens](./03-users/01-get-all-users-with-moxie-locked.mdx)
- [User's locked Moxie tokens amount](./03-users/02-get-users-locked-moxie-amount.mdx)
- [Token manager details](./04-token-manager/01-get-token-manager-details.mdx)
- etc.

You can access and test the API through the Subgraph Studio link <Link to={SUBGRAPH_URL.vesting}>here</Link>.
