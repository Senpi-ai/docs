## Role of MOXIE

Moxie's native asset MOXIE is an essential part of the Moxie economic engine, which continuously requires participants to buy and lock-up MOXIE into Moxie Protocol contracts, while the Protocol burns MOXIE with every transaction. 

- Members require MOXIE in order to purchase Fan Tokens of Members, Channels, and the Farcaster Network via Moxie Batch Auctions and Bonding Curve Contracts. Fan Tokens provide numerous benefits. 

- 3rd parties must acquire MOXIE and lock it in the Rewards contract to offer "proof of work" Rewards in the protocol. 

MOXIE swapped for Fan Tokens are locked in the protocol until sold. 

Every time a Fan Token is auctioned or sold, the protocol collects a 5% fee. 

After Fan Token Auctions, 100% of the Protocol Fee (5%) is set to be burned 

Every time a Fan Token is sold:

50% of the fee (5% x 50% = 2.5%) is distributed to the Subject whose Fan Tokens are being sold

50% of the fee (5% x 50% = 2.5%) is in MOXIE collected by the protocol and currently set to be burned. 

The fee amounts and usage of the fees can only be changed by DAO vote
