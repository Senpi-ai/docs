# Everyday Rewards

15% of the Moxie token supply (1.5B tokens) is specifically allocated for Farcaster Engagement Mining — rewarding Farcaster Members for contributions that help grow the Farcaster Network.

At launch, Moxie has partnered with Airstack to provision daily Everyday Rewards to Farcaster Members for quality content creation utilizing Airstack’s Cast Score for every cast and reply (formerly Social Capital Value). Airstack’s Cast Score works as follows:

- Every Farcaster Member is assigned a Far Score based on their influence in the Farcaster network (formerly known as Social Capital Score). The exact algorithm for the Far Score is kept confidential so it cannot be easily gamed or sybil attacked.

- Every cast and reply on Farcaster earns a Cast Score based on the Far Scores of the users who engage with their content and the type of engagement.

- MOXIE is rewarded 1:1 based on the Cast Score

- Rewards are automatically distributed as follows:

  - 50% to the member who casted

  - 20% to their Fans (holders of their Fan Tokens)

  - 20% to the Fans of the Channel casted into (holders of their Fan Tokens)

  - 10% to Fans of Farcaster overall (holders of the Fan Tokens)

Members can check their Everyday Rewards earnings via Frames and on the Airstack website, and will be able to make daily claims on their rewards in Frame.

MOXIE rewarded from Everyday Rewards are available to use immediately with no vesting schedule.

In addition, any project can present a "Common Goods" proposal to the Moxie Foundation for an allocation from the Engagement Mining bucket.

Common Goods rewards are rewards that are deemed by the Moxie DAO to be in the best interest of the Moxie protocol and not serving the specific interests of any 3rd party.

Rewards provisioned from the Engagement Mining bucket shall be inflation adjusted in accordance with the overall growth of the Farcaster Network and any changes in the MOXIE price, and managed by the Moxie DAO.

Furthermore an additional 25% of the token supply is dedicated to growing the protocol and for partner programs and grants.
