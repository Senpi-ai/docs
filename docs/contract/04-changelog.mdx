# Changelog

## November 22, 2024

The `erc721ContractAddress` state variable in the [`MoxiePassVerifier.sol`](./03-references/03-moxiepassverifier.mdx) contract have been set as the null/zero address.

Thus, Moxie Pass will no longer be needed for any [Base](https://base.org) address to buy or hold any Fan Token on the Moxie protocol.
