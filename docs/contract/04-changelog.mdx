# Changelog

## December 4, 2024

### Pull Requests

- [#55](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/contracts/pull/55) Upgrading contracts to include referral fees for buying/selling/auctioning Creator Coins.

### Developer Impact

New contract `ProtocolRewards` have been deployed along with upgrades on several existing contracts to include referral fees for buying, selling, and auctioning Creator Coins. The referral fees will be distributed to the referrer's wallet address.

No breaking changes have been made to the contract and you can continue to use the same addresses for the upgraded contracts with their respective existing functions.

Contracts upgraded in this PR are:

- [`MoxieBondingCurve.sol`](./03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx)
- [`SubjectFactory.sol`](./03-references/07-subjectfactory.mdx)
- [`Staking.sol`](./03-references/06-staking.mdx)

For these upgraded contracts, you can also find new "V2" functions added with additional referral address inputs to receive the referral fees for each transactions.

## November 22, 2024

The Moxie protocol is now available for all ðŸ”µ Base users! Here are the changes made on the protocol level:

- The `erc721ContractAddress` state variable in the [`MoxiePassVerifier.sol`](./03-references/03-moxiepassverifier.mdx) contract have been set as the null/zero address.
  - This changes enable any Creator Coins to be bought and hold by all Base users without the need for [Moxie Pass](../learn/glossary.mdx#moxie-pass).
- The `transferAllowList` state variable in the [`TokenManager.sol`](./03-references/09-tokenmanager.mdx) contract is now an empty array.
  - With the variable empty, this [line of code](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/contracts/blob/dev/packages/protocol/contracts/TokenManager.sol#L148C13-L148C30) will disable the restriction to transfer Creator Coins from one wallet to another.

With these changes, all ðŸ”µ Base users will now have full access to participate in Moxie protocol and be able to buy, hold, and transfer Creator Coins.
