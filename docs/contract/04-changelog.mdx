# Changelog

## November 22, 2024

The Moxie protocol is now available for all ðŸ”µ Base users! Here are the changes made on the protocol level:

- The `erc721ContractAddress` state variable in the [`MoxiePassVerifier.sol`](./03-references/03-moxiepassverifier.mdx) contract have been set as the null/zero address.
  - This changes enable any Fan Tokens to be bought and hold by all Base users without the need for [Moxie Pass](../learn/glossary.mdx#moxie-pass).
- The `transferAllowList` state variable in the [`TokenManager.sol`](./03-references/09-tokenmanager.mdx) contract is now an empty array.
  - With the variable empty, this [line of code](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/contracts/blob/dev/packages/protocol/contracts/TokenManager.sol#L148C13-L148C30) will disable the restriction to transfer Fan Tokens from one wallet to another.

With these changes, all ðŸ”µ Base users will now have full access to participate in Moxie protocol and be able to buy, hold, and transfer Fan Tokens.
