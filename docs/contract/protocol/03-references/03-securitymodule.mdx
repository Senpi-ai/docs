# SecurityModule.sol

The security module contract is responsible for managing the pausing and unpausing of the protocol. It is a simple contract that inherits from the OpenZeppelin `AccessControlUpgradeable` and `PausableUpgradeable` contracts. The contract has a single role, `PAUSE_ROLE`, which is used to control who can pause and unpause the protocol.

## Functions

### pause

Pauses the protocol. This function can only be called by an account with the `PAUSE_ROLE`.

```js
function pause() public onlyRole(PAUSE_ROLE) {
    _pause();
}
```

### unpause

Unpauses the protocol. This function can only be called by an account with the `PAUSE_ROLE`.

```js
function unpause() public onlyRole(PAUSE_ROLE) {
    _unpause();
}
```
