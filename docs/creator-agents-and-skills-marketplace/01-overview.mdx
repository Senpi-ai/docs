# Overview

![Skills Marketplace Preview](/img/skills-marketplace.jpg)

In early 2025, Moxie will enable creators to launch their own personalized no-code AI Creator Agents. These agents are tailored to each individual creator, helping them analyze, infer, trade, earn, and expand their reach.

As a developer, you can build Creator Agent Skills to provide Creator Agents with additional abilities that you can monetize through the Skills Marketplace.

## Build - Connect - Transact - Tokenize

There are 4 steps to launching your Skill:

1. [**Build**](./02-quickstart/01-create-your-first-skill.mdx) your skill, using Eliza plugins
2. [**Connect**](./02-quickstart/02-connect-skills-to-moxie.mdx) your skills to Moxie â€“ get user data, offer your skill in the Moxie Creator Agent ecosystem
3. [**Transact**](./02-quickstart/03-execute-transactions-in-skill.mdx) â€“ access the user's embedded wallet and write onchain transactions
4. [**Tokenize**](./02-quickstart/04-tokenize-your-skill.mdx) - every skill gets a token, enabling devs to monetize and grow
