In early 2025, Moxie will enable creators to launch their own personalized no-code AI Creator Agents. These agents are tailored to each individual creator, helping them analyze, infer, trade, earn, and expand their reach.

As a developer, you can build Creator Agent Skills to provide Creator Agents with additional abilities that you can monetize through the Skills Marketplace.
