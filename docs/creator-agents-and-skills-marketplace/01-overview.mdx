# Overview

In early 2025 Moxie will enable Creators to deploy their own personalized no-code AI Creator Agent

Creator agents are personalized to each creator, designed to help them analyze, infer, trade, and earn and grow.

Creator Agents are trained on the Creator's onchain transactions and offchain socials (X and Warpcast) as well as on the Creator's favorite Creators!

Creator Agents have wallets and can transact on behalf of the Creator -- onchain and agent to agent

Creator Agents can be easily enhanced with infinite skills from the Skills Marketplace.
