## Pre-requisites

Creator Skills are essentially custom Eliza plugin that can be built to enhance your Creator Agents.

Thus, before getting started with development, ensure that you have fulfilled all the pre-requisites for running Eliza Framework:

- Node.js 23+
- pnpm 9+
- Git for version control
- A code editor (VS Code or VSCodium recommended)
- CUDA Toolkit (optional, for GPU acceleration)

Once the environment is setup, make sure that you have completed the [Eliza Quickstart guide](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/quickstart/) and setup your own AI agent.

## Step 1: Define A New Plugin

First, create

```ts
import { Plugin } from "@elizaos/core";

const myFirstMoxieSkill: Plugin = {
  name: "my-first-moxie-skill",
  description: "My First Moxie Skill",
  actions: [],
};
```

## Step 2: Create New Action & Providers For The Agent

```ts
import {
  Action,
  IAgentRuntime,
  Memory,
  HandlerCallback,
  State,
  composeContext,
  generateObject,
  ModelClass,
  elizaLogger,
} from "@elizaos/core";

const myFirstMoxieAction: Action = {
  name: "SWAP_TOKEN",
  similes: ["BUY_TOKEN", "PURCHASE_TOKEN"],
  description: "Swap one token for another token",
  validate: async function (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state?: State
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    return true;
  },
  handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state?: State,
    options?: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback?: HandlerCallback
  ) => {
    try {
    } catch {}
  },
  examples: [
    [
      {
        user: "{{user1}}",
        content: {
          text: "Create a new resource with the name 'Resource1' and type 'TypeA'",
        },
      },
      {
        user: "{{agentName}}",
        content: {
          text: `Resource created successfully:
- Name: Resource1
- Type: TypeA`,
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};

export default myFirstMoxieAction;
```

Once the Action is defined, simply integrate it to your plugin by importing and adding it to the `actions` field:

```ts
import { Action } from "@elizaos/core";
import myFirstMoxieAction from ".";

const myFirstMoxieSkill: Plugin = {
  name: "my-first-moxie-skill",
  description: "My First Moxie Skill",
  actions: [myFirstMoxieAction],
};
```

Other than Eliza Action, you can also customize your Moxie Skill further by adding custom providers, evaluators, or services to build more interesting feature.

## Step 3: Test Your Plugin With The Agent

```ts

```

Then, run a client for testing:

```sh
npm run start:client
```
