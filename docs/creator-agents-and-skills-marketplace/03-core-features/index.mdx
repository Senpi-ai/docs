# Core Features

On top of the basic features offered by the Eliza Framework, Moxie Skills Framework repository also provides a set of core features that can be used to build more advanced and complex Skills.

These features are designed to help you access user-level data such as wallets, username, Moxie ID and also execute transaction on behalf of user's embedded wallets.
