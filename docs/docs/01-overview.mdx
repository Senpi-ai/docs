# Overview

![Skills Marketplace Preview](/img/skills-marketplace.png)

Senpi enables users to launch their own personalized AI Assistants. These AI Assistants are tailored to each individual user, helping them analyze, infer, trade, and earn. Users customize and add more functionality to their AI Assistants by adding “skills.”

Developers can easily offer skills with open source Eliza plugins integrated into Senpi.

## Senpi Eliza Skills Framework

The [Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills) is an end-to-end AI Agent development framework, based on the [Eliza Framework](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza), that enables developers to integrate custom AI Agent Skills (based on Eliza Plugins system) to enhance AI Assistants to perform complex tasks, transact with user wallets, and be monetized through the Skills Marketplace.

In addition to the features offered by the Eliza Framework, such as:

- **Agent Runtime**
  - **Character System**
  - **Actions**
  - **Evaluators**
  - **Providers**
- **Memory & Database Management**
- **Caching System**
- etc.

the [Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills) offers a set of features that are specific for Skills Development:

- **Agent Wallet**: An embedded wallet that is controlled by the AI agent and owned by the user that can be used to execute on-chain transactions for users
- **Senpi Agent Lib**: A library of functions that can be used to execute onchain transactions on EVM chains, sign messages and typed data, and fetch various Moxie-specific data
- **Senpi Client**: A custom client that injects Moxie user data into the runtime's state
