# Based Rewards Leaderboard

To view the top Based Rewards earner on the Moxie protocol live data, you can simply go to the User Rewards Live table [here](https://dune.com/queries/4544813).

The table is pre-sorted by rewards earned in descending order by default, ensuring the top earner is prominently displayed at the top, followed by others in rank.

Alternatively, you can also make modifications to the query to sort by other parameters.

Users can identified using the Moxie User ID on the leftmost column. To identify the user, simply go to `https://moxie.xyz/profile/<moxie-user-id>` to check their profile and their connected addresses & web2/web3 socials.
