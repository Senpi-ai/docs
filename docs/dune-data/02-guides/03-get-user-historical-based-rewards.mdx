# Get User Historical Based Rewards

Simply fork [this Dune table](https://dune.com/queries/4468458). Then, delete the existing query and replace with the following query below and `<moxie-user-id>` added as the desired user to search:

```sql {4}
Select
    *
FROM dune.moxieprotocol.user_rewards_snapshot
WHERE dune.moxieprotocol.user_rewards_snapshot.user_id='<moxie-user-id>'
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

Once that's done, simply click on the `Run` button to get the result.
