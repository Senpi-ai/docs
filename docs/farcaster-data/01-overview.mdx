# Overview

In the Moxie protocol, a user can participate in the protocol either through one of their Farcaster verified wallet (must have Moxie Pass NFT) or their respective vesting contract address (if they earn airdrops).

While a user on Farcaster is identified by their FID, a user on-chain action on the Moxie protocol is identified through their beneficiary and vesting contract addresses instead

Thus, you must be able to resolve between FIDs and their addresses, either beneficiary or vesting contract, to fetch the necessary data from the subgraphs or execute a smart contract function on the Moxie protocol.

To simplify the resolution, here we provide you with a static JSON file that you can [download](/farcaster-data/guides/download-data) and include in your project.

:::info[Alternatives: API solutions]

As an alternative solution, you can also use a third-party API provider, such as [Airstack](https://airstack.xyz), to resolve the identities.

However, keep in mind that this might increase the latency of your application as you will need to make additional API calls.
