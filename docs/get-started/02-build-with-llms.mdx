# Build with LLMs

If you prefer to build you Senpi Skills with your own LLMs or in a AI-powered IDE, you can use the `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files we provide.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "llms-full.txt",
      href: "https://developer.senpi.ai/llms-full.txt",
    },
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "llms.txt",
      href: "https://developer.senpi.ai/llms.txt",
    },
  ]}
/>
