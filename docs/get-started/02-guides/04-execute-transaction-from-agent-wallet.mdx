# Execute Transaction From Agent Wallet

<CopyPageButton />

An agent wallet is an embedded wallet that is controlled by the AI agent and owned by the user that can be used to execute on-chain transactions for users.

Each user that created a Senpi account on [senpi.ai](https://senpi.ai) automatically assigned a unique agent wallet, which on the the platform is labeled as an **Embedded Wallet**.

As a skills developer, you can access the user's agent wallet to execute onchain transactions and sign messages.

## Accessing the Agent Wallet

To access the agent wallet instance, you can simply use the `agentWallet` state in your skill that is injected by the [Senpi Client](../../references/moxie-client/index.mdx) as shown below:

```typescript
const agentWallet = state.agentWallet;
```

Keep in mind that in production, the agent wallet will be dynamically injected into the skill's runtime state depending on the user interacting with the skill.

However, for local development purposes, the agent wallet will be based on the private key that you have set in the local `.env` file.
