# Sign Message Using Agent Wallet

<CopyPageButton />

An agent wallet is an embedded wallet that is controlled by the AI agent and owned by the user that can be used to execute on-chain transactions for users.

Each user that created a Senpi account on [senpi.ai](https://senpi.ai) automatically assigned a unique agent wallet, which on the the platform is labeled as an **Embedded Wallet**.

As a skills developer, you can access the user's agent wallet to execute onchain transactions and sign messages.

## Signing Messages Using the Agent Wallet

To sign messages using the agent wallet, you can simply use the `senpiWalletClient` state in your skill that is injected by the [Senpi Client](../../references/senpi-client/index.mdx) as shown below:

:::info

Currently, only signing message on EVM chains are supported within the Senpi Eliza Skills Framework.

:::

```typescript {17-21}
import {
  type Action,
  type IAgentRuntime,
  type Memory,
  type HandlerCallback,
  type State,
} from "@senpi-ai/core";

export const exampleAction: Action = {
  handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback: HandlerCallback
  ) => {
    const senpiWalletClient = state.senpiWalletClient;
    // Sign a message using user's agent wallet
    const { signature, encoding } = await senpiWalletClient.signMessage(
      "Hello Senpi!"
    );
    return true;
  },
};
```

Keep in mind that in production, the agent wallet will be dynamically injected into the skill's runtime state depending on the user interacting with the skill.

However, for local development purposes, the agent wallet will be **based on the private key** that you have set in the local `.env` file.

## Signing EIP-712 Typed Data Messages

To sign EIP-712 typed data messages, you can use the `signTypedData` function in your skill's action code as shown below:

```typescript {17-24}
import {
  type Action,
  type IAgentRuntime,
  type Memory,
  type HandlerCallback,
  type State,
} from "@senpi-ai/core";

export const exampleAction: Action = {
  handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: { [key: string]: unknown },
    callback: HandlerCallback
  ) => {
    const senpiWalletClient = state.senpiWalletClient;
    // Sign a EIP-712 typed data message using user's agent wallet
    const { signature, encoding } = await senpiWalletClient.signTypedData(
      domain,
      types,
      message,
      primaryType
    );
    return true;
  },
};
```

Similar to regular message signing, the agent wallet will be dynamically injected into the skill's runtime state depending on the user interacting with the skill.

For local development purposes, the agent wallet will be **based on the private key** that you have set in the local `.env` file.
