<CopyPageButton />

Once you completed development on your skills, you can register your skills to the Skills Marketplace by the following steps:

## Step 1: Adjust the Skills Metadata

Adjust your AI Agent Skills metadata in the Skills Registry in `registry/src/skills.json` with the values and configurations you want to display in the Skills Marketplace.

```ts
interface Skills {
  pluginId: string; // Any UUID, must be unique, to generate one use this https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
  name: string; // AI Agent Skills name (based on package.json)
  displayName: string; // Display name shown in marketplace
  version: string; // AI Agent Skills Version (based on package.json)
  author: string | null; // Author/Creator of the Skills
  description: string; // Description of what the Skills can do
  githubUrl: string; // GitHub URL to your Skills folder under `/packages`
  logoUrl: string; // Logo URL for the skill (400x400 px PNG)
  settings: Record<string, any>; // Skill settings configuration
  capabilities: string[]; // List of skill capabilities
  starterQuestions: Array<{
    label: string;
    value: string;
  }>; // Example questions to get started
  mediaUrls: string[]; // Additional media URLs
  actions: string[]; // Supported actions & similes on the Skill
  isPremium: boolean; // Whether skill is premium or not, if yes, it will check `freeQueries` and `skillCoinAddress`
  freeQueries: number; // Number of free queries available for users in the case of premium skills
  skillCoinAddress: string; // Coin address to token gate the Skill
  minimumSkillBalance: number; // Minimum token balance required
  status: string; // Skill status, "ACTIVE" or "INACTIVE"
  isDefault: boolean; // 3rd party Skill should be `false`
  loaders: string[]; // Messages when loading AI agent responses
}
```

## Step 2: Request `.env` Variables for Production (Optional)

If your AI Agent Skill require environment variable for production purpose, then fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/8hzDyCVKKLs4MkTEA) to request submission. The Senpi team shall directly reach out to you either through **Email** ([support@airstack.xyz](mailto:support@airstack.xyz)) or **Farcaster** (group chat) for submission.

## Step 3: Create a Pull Request

Lastly, commit all the changes you made on your branches and create a new [PR](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills/pulls) to the repository's `main` branch. <br /><br />Before requesting for review, make sure that you have fulfilled all the requirements in the [pre-launch checklist](../../guidelines-and-policies/pre-launch-checklist.mdx).<br/><br />The Senpi team will review the newly created AI Agent Skills and once merged, your Skills will automatically be registered to the Skills Marketplace where it's accessible for Senpi users to use.
