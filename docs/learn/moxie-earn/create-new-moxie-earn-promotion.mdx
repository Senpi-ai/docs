## Step 1: Setup A New Campaign

To create a new campaign, you will need to define **the target audience** you're looking to reach and the **rewards boost** you would like to provide for user quote casting the promoted casts.

### Target Audience

For target audience, by default it will be set to `All Farcasters` which

You can narrow down your target audience by adding some rules. Currently, these are the available criteria for you to establish your rules:

| Criteria            | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Channel followers` | The number of followers a Farcaster has          |
| `Channel members`   | The number of members in a Farcaster's channel   |
| `FarRank`           | The rank of a Farcaster based on their FAR score |
| `FarScore`          | The FAR score of a Farcaster                     |
| `Followed By`       | The number of Farcaster's followers              |
