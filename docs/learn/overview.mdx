# Moxie Overview

Welcome to the Moxie Developer Hub! ðŸ‘‹

## Creator Agents and Skills Marketplace

Start learning how to build Creator Agent Skills for Creator Agents today!

There are 4 steps to launching your Skill:

1. [**Build**](../creator-agents-and-skills-marketplace/02-quickstart/01-create-your-first-skill.mdx) your skill, using Eliza plugins
2. [**Connect**](../creator-agents-and-skills-marketplace/02-quickstart/02-connect-skills-to-moxie.mdx) your skills to Moxie â€“ get user data, offer your skill in the Moxie Creator Agent ecosystem
3. [**Transact**](../creator-agents-and-skills-marketplace/02-quickstart/03-execute-transactions-in-skill.mdx) â€“ access the user's embedded wallet and write onchain transactions
4. [**Tokenize**](../creator-agents-and-skills-marketplace/02-quickstart/04-tokenize-your-skill.mdx) - every skill gets a token, enabling devs to monetize and grow

    },
  ]}
/>

In addition, you can also explore further in detail all the available subgraphs, contracts, and third-party APIs that you can use to build on top of the Moxie protocol.

## Subgraphs

There are a number of subgraphs that you can use to index on-chain data from the Moxie protocol. Each subgraphs are designed to provide you with a different set of data points that you can use to support various use cases.

The list of subgraphs that are available are:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Protocol Subgraph",
      href: "/api/protocol/overview",
      description:
        "Fetch Creator Coins balances, holdings, buy/sell orders on the bonding curves, and more.",
    },
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Auction Subgraph",
      href: "/api/auction/overview",
      description:
        "Fetch Creator Coin auctions data from the Moxie protocol's auction contract.",
    },
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Vesting Subgraph",
      href: "/api/vesting/overview",
      description:
        "Fetch vesting data from the Moxie protocol's vesting contract.",
    },
  ]}
/>

Each subgraph is accessible via the Subgraph Studio for free but will be rate-limited. If you need higher throughput for your use case, you can use the associated network subgraph on the Graph network.

You can check out the full source code of the collection of subgraphs in the [Moxie Subgraph GitHub repository](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/Subgraphs).

## Contracts

The Moxie protocol is composed of a series of smart contracts deployed on the Base mainnet that define the protocol mechanism and functionality as laid out in the [whitepaper](https://build.moxie.xyz/).

The contract has been audited by Code4rena and you can find the audit report [here](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/contracts/tree/dev/audit).

To learn more about the contracts, you can check out the Moxie contract references:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Contract References",
      href: "/contract/references",
      description:
        "Learn all the solidity functions and events that are available in the Moxie protocol contracts.",
    },
  ]}
/>

You can also check out the full source code of the Moxie protocol contracts in the [Moxie Contracts GitHub repository](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/contracts).

## Third-Party APIs

Airstack provides GraphQL API for querying certain Moxie Protocol data.

You can access the Airstack GraphQL API with this endpoint https://api.airstack.xyz/graphql.

For this, you'll be required to get an [Airstack API key](https://docs.airstack.xyz/airstack-docs-and-faqs/get-started/get-api-key).

For access to the Airstack API key, you'll need to **hold at least 1 /airstack Channel Creator Coin** in either your Farcaster custodial wallet or one of your Farcaster verified wallets AND make sure that you have connected one of those wallet or your Farcaster account to your Airstack account.

If you don't have it yet, you can buy it [here](https://www.airstack.xyz/channels/airstack).
