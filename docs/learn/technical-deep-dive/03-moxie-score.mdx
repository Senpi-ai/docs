# Moxie Score

The **Moxie Score** represents a user's engagement level, calculated based on the wallets and Web2 social accounts they have connected to their Moxie profile. A higher **Moxie Score** correlates with increased [**Based Rewards**](./04-based-rewards.mdx).

The Moxie Score is determined by summing the points earned from meeting specific criteria associated with the connected wallets and Web2 social accounts. This can be expressed through the following equation:

$$
M_{score}(U) = \sum_{i=1}^n C_i(U)
$$

where:

| Notation         | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$n$$            | Total number of criteria that contribute to the Moxie Score                       |
| $$M_{score}(U)$$ | Moxie Score of user $$U$$                                                         |
| $$C_i(U)$$       | The score added to the Moxie Score of user $$U$$ based on the $$i^{th}$$ criteria |

The list of all criteria that contribute to the Moxie Score is shown in the table below:
