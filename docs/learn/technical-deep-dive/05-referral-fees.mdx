# Referral Fees

## Overview

Referral fees are rewards provided to third parties for facilitating user activities such as buying, selling, or auctioning a Creator Coin on the Moxie protocol.

The Moxie protocol offers three types of referral fees:

- [**Buy/Sell Referral Fees**](#buysell-referral-fees)
- [**Auction Referral Fees**](#auction-referral-fees)
- [**Signup Referral Fees**](#signup-referral-fees)

Each type has a unique fee split structure. For detailed information about referral fees and their respective split structures, visit [here](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol).

## Contract Architecture

Referral fees are primarily managed by the `ProtocolRewards.sol` contract. This singleton contract is deployed once and handles the deposit and withdrawal of all referral fees.

Currently, only referrals on buy/sell transactions can included independently on-chain by calling the relevant smart contract functions.

Auction & signup referrals, however, can only be made through the referral links generated by [moxie.xyz](https://moxie.xyz).

### Buy/Sell Referral Fees

For every buy and sell Creator Coin transactions that occurs on your platform, you can include your address as a referrer to receive the referral fees from each transaction.

This can be done easily by calling "v2" functions added from the [December 4, 2024 contract upgrade](../../contract/04-changelog.mdx#december-4-2024) in both the [`MoxieBondingCurveV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx) and [`StakingV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx) contracts. Those functions are:

| Functions                                                                                      | Contract                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`buySharesV2`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx#buysharesv2)             | [`MoxieBondingCurveV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx) |
| [`buySharesForV2`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx#buysharesforv2)       | [`MoxieBondingCurveV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx) |
| [`sellSharesV2`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx#sellsharesv2)           | [`MoxieBondingCurveV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx) |
| [`sellSharesForV2`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx#sellsharesforv2)     | [`MoxieBondingCurveV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx) |
| [`buyAndLockV2`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx#buyandlock)                       | [`StakingV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx)                     |
| [`buyAndLockForV2`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx#buyandlockfor)                 | [`StakingV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx)                     |
| [`buyAndLockMultipleV2`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx#buyandlockmultiple)       | [`StakingV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx)                     |
| [`buyAndLockMultipleForV2`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx#buyandlockmultiplefor) | [`StakingV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx)                     |

When a user is calling one of the above functions on your platform, you can include your address in the `_orderReferrer` parameter to assign yourself as a parameter.

From there, the [`MoxieBondingCurveV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/01-moxiebondingcurve.mdx) and [`StakingV2.sol`](../../contract/03-references/06-staking.mdx) contracts will automatically calculate and deposit the referral fees into the `ProtocolRewards.sol` contract.

```

Once the referral fees are deposited into the `ProtocolRewards.sol` contract, they can be withdrawn anytime.

For buy/sell referral fees withdrawal from the `ProtocolRewards.sol` contract, simply call the `withdraw` function.

- [Buy Creator Coins On Behalf Of Others](../../use-cases/fan-tokens/02-buy-fan-tokens-on-behalf-of-others.mdx)
- [Sell Creator Coins](../../use-cases/fan-tokens/03-sell-fan-tokens.mdx)
- [Sell Creator Coins On Behalf Of Others](../../use-cases/fan-tokens/04-sell-fan-tokens-on-behalf-of-others.mdx)

In addition, if you successfully onboard another user to [moxie.xyz](https://moxie.xyz), you can earn 0.15% [signup referral fees](#signup-referral-fees) for every buy/sell transactions from that user indefinitely.

### Auction Referral Fees

Auction referral fees are rewards provided to referrers who promoted certain Creator Coin auction to another user that successfully bid on it.

For every successful bid on a Creator Coin auction that you referred, you will earn 1.5% of that particular auction order proceeds.

Auction referral fees for this will be handled off-chain and will be paid out to the `ProtocolRewards.sol` contract where all other referral fees are accumulated and can be claimed on-chain.

### Signup Referral Fees

Signup referral fees are rewards provided to referrers for successfully onboarding new users to create a new account in [moxie.xyz](https://moxie.xyz).

For every user that you successfully onboard to [moxie.xyz](https://moxie.xyz), you will be labelled as a **Platform Referrer** by Moxie for those users and will earn:

- 0.15% referral fees for every buy/sell transactions from that user indefinitely
- 1.5% of that user's Creator Coin auction proceeds when they launch a Creator Coin
- 10% of that user's [Moxie Score](03-moxie-score.mdx) added to your Moxie Score

Signup referral fees for this will be handled off-chain and will be paid out to the `ProtocolRewards.sol` contract where all other referral fees are accumulated and can be claimed on-chain.
