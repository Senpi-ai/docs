# Rewards Split

By default [Everyday Rewards](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol/everyday-rewards) earned from Casts and Frames by a member are split as follows:

- 50% to the member who earned the reward
- 20% to their Fans (holders of their Fan Tokens)
- 20% to the Fans of the Channel casted into (holders of their Fan Tokens)
- 10% to Fans of Farcaster overall (holders of the Fan Tokens)

If your address is a subject of a Member Fan Token, you will have access to modify the split percentages for the rewards. Currently, there are 3 options for the split:

**Option 1: 50% For Fans**

  - 20% to the member who earned the reward

- 10% to Fans of Farcaster overall (holders of the Fan Tokens)

**Option 2: 70% For Fans**
