# Rewards Split

By default [Everyday Rewards](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol/everyday-rewards) earned from Casts and Frames by a member are split as follows:

- 50% to the member who earned the reward
- 20% to their Fans (holders of their Creator Coins)
- 20% to the Fans of the Channel casted into (holders of their Creator Coins)
- 10% to Fans of Farcaster overall (holders of the Creator Coins)

If your address is a subject of a Member Creator Coin, you will have access to modify the split percentages for the rewards. Currently, there are 3 options for the split:
