![Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](/img/architecture.png)

On top of the basic features offered by the Eliza Framework, [Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills) repository also provides a set of core features that can be used to build more advanced and complex Skills.

Those core features unique to the [Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills) are:

- **User Agent Wallets**: A user-owned embedded wallet that agents can use to execute onchain actions (e.g., trades, staking).
- [**Senpi Agent Lib**](./moxie-agent-lib/02-moxie-agent-lib.mdx): Utilities for executing transactions via the agent wallet & fetching Senpi data.
- [**Senpi Client**](./moxie-client/index.mdx): Injects user data into states, available globally.
