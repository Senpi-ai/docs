![Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](/img/architecture.png)

On top of the basic features offered by the Eliza Framework, [Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-agent-skills) repository also provides a set of core features that can be used to build more advanced and complex Skills.

Those core features unique to the [Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-agent-skills) are:

- **User Agent Wallets**: A user-owned embedded wallet that agents can use to execute onchain actions (e.g., trades, staking).
- [**Senpi Agent Lib**](./senpi-agent-lib/index.mdx): Utilities for executing transactions via the agent wallet & fetching Senpi-related data.
- [**Senpi Client**](./senpi-client/index.mdx): Injects user data into states, available globally.

As a Skill developer, you can import both [**Senpi Agent Lib**](./senpi-agent-lib/index.mdx) and [**Senpi Client**](./senpi-client/index.mdx) to your Skill's codebase to create responses based on the user's data and execute transactions for Senpi users via the agent wallet.

For more technicals on the available functions and variables from both libraries, you can respectively refer to the [**Senpi Agent Lib**](./senpi-agent-lib/index.mdx) and [**Senpi Client**](./senpi-client/index.mdx) reference docs.
