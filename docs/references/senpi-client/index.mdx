# Senpi Client

The Senpi Client is a specialized Eliza client that extends the `DirectClient` class, serving as the primary interface for users on [senpi.ai](https://senpi.ai) to interact with their agents.

One of its key features is the ability to inject authenticated users data into predefined states, enabling developers to access relevant information during Skill development.

In the [Senpi Eliza Skills Framework](https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-agent-skills), the Senpi Client does not include an authentication layer for local development purposes. Consequently, the injected states will return mock data instead of real user data.

These states include:

| State                  | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `agentName`            | The name of the agent                   |
| `moxieUserInfo`        | The authenticated user's information    |
| `agentWallet`          | Details of the agent's wallet           |
| `moxieWalletClient`    | A `MoxieWalletClient` instance          |
| `currentWalletBalance` | The ERC20 balance of the current wallet |
