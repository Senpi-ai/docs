# Get Everyday Rewards Split Of A User

By default [Everyday Rewards](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol/everyday-rewards) earned from Casts and Frames by a member are split as follows:

- 70% to their Fans (holders of their Creator Coins)
- 20% to the Fans of the Channel casted into (holders of their Creator Coins)
- 10% to Fans of Farcaster overall (holders of the Creator Coins)

The Everyday Rewards split is currently offchain and available to fetch from the Airstack API. To learn more on how to fetch the Everyday Rewards split of a certain user, click [here](https://docs.airstack.xyz/airstack-docs-and-faqs/moxie/moxie-everyday-rewards-split).
