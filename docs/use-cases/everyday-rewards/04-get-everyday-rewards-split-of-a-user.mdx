# Get Everyday Rewards Split Of A User

By default [Everyday Rewards](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol/everyday-rewards) earned from Casts and Frames by a member are split as follows:

- 70% to their Fans (holders of their Creator Coins)
- 20% to the Fans of the Channel casted into (holders of their Creator Coins)
- 10% to Fans of Farcaster overall (holders of the Creator Coins)

This split can be modified by the address that is the subject of the Member Creator Coin.

To learn more about the different split options and how it can impact [Everyday Rewards](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol/everyday-rewards) distribution on the Moxie protocol, click [here](../../learn/technical-deep-dive/rewards-split.mdx).

The Everyday Rewards split is currently offchain and available to fetch from the Airstack API.
