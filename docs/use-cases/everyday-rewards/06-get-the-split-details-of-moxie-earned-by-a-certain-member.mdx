# Get The Split Details Of Moxie Earned By A Certain Member

The [Everyday Rewards](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol/everyday-rewards) earned by a Farcaster user through Casts and Frames are generally distributed among multiple parties. These parties include the member (the user), their fans, channel fans (if the Cast/Frame was posted in a channel), and the Farcaster network fans.

By default, the distribution is as follows, though it can be customized by the user:

- 50% to the member who earned the reward
- 20% to their Fans (holders of their Fan Tokens)
- 20% to the Fans of the Channel casted into (holders of their Fan Tokens)
- 10% to Fans of Farcaster overall (holders of the Fan Tokens)

This means that any Moxie earned by a member contributes to the earnings of these various groups.

The Moxie earning data split is currently offchain and available to fetch from the [Airstack API](https://app.airstack.xyz).
