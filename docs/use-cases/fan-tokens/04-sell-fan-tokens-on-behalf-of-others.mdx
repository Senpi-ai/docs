# Sell Creator Coins On Behalf Of Others

In this tutorial, you will learn step-by-step on how to sell any Creator Coins and transfer it to a third-party [Base](https://www.base.org/) address on the Moxie protocol through the bonding curve contract.

While the tutorial shown here will be using [viem](https://viem.sh) in TypeScript, you should be able to use other programming language and their web3-equivalent libraries to execute the Creator Coin buying process. Alternatives web3 libraries you can use are:

- [ethers.js (JS/TS)](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
- [web3.js (JS/TS)](https://www.web3js.org/)
- [web3.py (Python)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- etc.

## Pre-requisites

1. Install dependencies

<Install dependencies="viem" />

2. Download the [Subject ERC20 Token](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/contracts/blob/dev/packages/protocol/ignition/deployments/base-mainnet/artifacts/ProtocolContracts%23SubjectERC20.json) and [Moxie Bonding Curve ABI](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/contracts/blob/dev/packages/protocol/ignition/deployments/base-mainnet/artifacts/ProtocolContracts%23MoxieBondingCurve.json).

3. Make sure to have some Moxie Creator Coins to sell from your wallet and sufficient Base ETH to cover the transaction fees.

## Step 1: Setup Client

First, setup a viem client and provide the mnemonic of your account to create an `account` instance:

:::info[Keep Your Mnemonic Secure]

Ensure to store the mnemonic securley and privately as an environment variable so that your wallet address will not be compromised.

:::

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createWalletClient, createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { mnemonicToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

const account = mnemonicToAccount("YOUR_WALLET_MNEMONIC");

const client = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: base,
  transport: http(),
});

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http(),
});
```

## Step 2: Check Creator Coin Allowance

To check the Creator Coin Allowance, simply call the `allowance` function from the specified Creator Coin contract.

When calling the `allowance` function set the parameters as follows:

| Parameter | Value                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner`   | Either the senders's EOA wallet or vesting contract address.                                                        |
| `spender` | The [Moxie bonding curve contract address](https://basescan.org/address/0x373065e66B32a1C428aa14698dFa99BA7199B55E) |

## Step 3: Calculate Sell Price For Creator Coins

To calculate the sell price, call the Moxie bonding curve smart contract `calculateTokensForSell` with the following parameters:

| Parameter             | Value                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `_subjectTokenAmount` | how much FT user wanna buy (in wei)                  |
| `_subject`            | The subject address associated to the Creator Coins. |

## Step 4: Approve Creator Coins

If the Creator Coin `allowance` is either 0 or less than what is needed to sell the inputted amount of Creator Coins (from [Step 2](./04-sell-fan-tokens-on-behalf-of-others.mdx#step-2-check-fan-token-allowance)), then approval on the Creator Coin will need to be initiated to ensure that the buy transaction is successful.

Otherwise, if there is sufficient `allowance` value, skip to [Step 5](./04-sell-fan-tokens-on-behalf-of-others.mdx#step-5-execute-contract-call) to execute the buy Creator Coins transaction.

### EOA Wallet

From EOA wallet, simply call the `approve` function on the Creator Coin with the following variables:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spender` | the [Moxie bonding curve address](https://basescan.org/address/0x373065e66B32a1C428aa14698dFa99BA7199B55E) |
| `value`   | the amount of Moxie to buy FT                                                                              |

### Vesting Contract

From vesting contract there is the `approveSubjectToken` function that you can call by providing the Creator Coin's subject to the `_subject` parameter to approve a specific Creator Coin in your vesting contract to be accessible by other Moxie protocol contracts.

After the approval, all the Creator Coin in the vesting contract will be available for selling.

## Step 5: Execute Contract Call

Lastly, call the `sellSharesForV2` function on the Moxie bonding curve contract to execute the Creator Coin selling transaction:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="viem-ts" label="Viem (TS)">

```ts title="index.ts"
import client from "./client";
import { MoxieBondingCurveABI } from "./abi/ProtocolContracts#MoxieBondingCurve.json";

try {
  clientwriteContract({
    account,
    address: MoxieBondingCurveAddress, // or user's vesting contract address
    abi: MoxieBondingCurveABI,
    functionName: "sellSharesForV2",
    args: [
      // subject address
      "0x338fDD513Ed2eC7ee1249Ee286F967FC56492C78",
      //  amount of FT to sell
      BigInt("10000000000000000"),
      // the 3rd party address that will receive the Moxie Token from the selling
      "0xadd746be46ff36f10c81d6e3ba282537f4c68077",
      // (minimum) amount of Moxie to receive from the selling, calculated from step 2
      BigInt("263749847732490543"),
      // referrer address
      "0x2211d1d0020daea8039e46cf1367962070d77da9",
    ],
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Congrats! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ You've just successfully sold a Creator Coin and transfer it to a third-party address!
