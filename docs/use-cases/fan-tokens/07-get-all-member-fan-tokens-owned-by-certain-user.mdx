:::info[Include User's Vesting Addresses]

Moxie protocol users have Moxie token currently vesting in their vesting contract. A huge portion of them use these to bid on auctions and buy/sell fan tokens on the Moxie protocol.

Therefore, it is important that you include the user's vesting addresses in the query to get all member fan tokens owned by a certain user. To **get user's vesting contract addresses**, click [**here**](../vesting/01-get-users-vesting-contract-addresses.mdx).

# Pre-requisites

<Prerequisites />

## Step 1: Add The API Query To Your Code

<AddQuery
  useCase="get all the member-type fan tokens owned by a certain user in the Moxie protocol"
  subgraphLink={url.protocol_stats_subgraphs}
  query={`query MyQuery($userAddresses: [ID!], $symbol_starts_with: String) {
  users(where: { id_in: $userAddresses }) {
    portfolio(where: {subjectToken_: {symbol_starts_with: $symbol_starts_with}}) {
      balance
      subjectToken {
        address: id
        name
        symbol
        decimals
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variable={`{
  "userAddresses": [
    "0x075b108fc0a6426f9dec9a5c18e87eb577d1346a"
  ],
  // Check if the symbol starts with "fid:" to include only member-type fan tokens
  "symbol_starts_with": "fid:"
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "portfolio": [
          {
            "balance": "13020342330530893",
            "subjectToken": {
              "address": "0x9b4b438398c11c7dafdcc0cd2ef5240b58b709ba",
              "name": "horsefacts.eth",
              "symbol": "fid:3621",
              "decimals": "18"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Step 2: Execute Your Code

<ExecuteCode
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "portfolio": [
          {
            "balance": "13020342330530893",
            "subjectToken": {
              "address": "0x9b4b438398c11c7dafdcc0cd2ef5240b58b709ba",
              "name": "horsefacts.eth",
              "symbol": "fid:3621",
              "decimals": "18"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
  dataFetched="all the member-type fan tokens owned by a certain user in the Moxie protocol"
/>
