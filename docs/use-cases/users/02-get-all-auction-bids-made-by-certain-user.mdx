:::info[Include User's Vesting Addresses]

Moxie protocol users have Moxie token currently vesting in their vesting contract. A huge portion of them use these to bid on auctions and buy/sell Creator Coins on the Moxie protocol.

Therefore, it is important that you include the user's vesting addresses in the query to get all auction bids made by a certain user. To **get user's vesting contract addresses**, click [**here**](../vesting/01-get-users-vesting-contract-addresses.mdx).

## Step 1: Add The API Query To Your Code

<AddQuery
  useCase="get all auction bids made by a certain user"
  subgraphLink={url.auction_stats_subgraphs}
  query={`query MyQuery($userAddresses: [Bytes!]) {
  users(where: { addresses_in: $userAddress }) {
    participatedAuctions {
      auctionId
      auctioningToken {
        id
        symbol
        decimals
      }
      txHash
    }
    address
  }
}`}
  variable={`{
  "userAddresses":[
    "0x1a45675bd474c8e3056a7dbd19e738d7849c0d26"
  ]
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "participatedAuctions": [
          {
            "auctionId": "37",
            "auctioningToken": {
              "id": "0xf08c342445e8ca84476941078a109a496244187f",
              "symbol": "cid:goldy",
              "decimals": "18"
            },
            "txHash": "0x2a96c4e8032e8eb270f17f8e4487630b171be3c20a75e8547196378f54ffab5f"
          }
        ],
        "address": "0x1a45675bd474c8e3056a7dbd19e738d7849c0d26"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Step 2: Execute Your Code

<ExecuteCode
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "participatedAuctions": [
          {
            "auctionId": "37",
            "auctioningToken": {
              "id": "0xf08c342445e8ca84476941078a109a496244187f",
              "symbol": "cid:goldy",
              "decimals": "18"
            },
            "txHash": "0x2a96c4e8032e8eb270f17f8e4487630b171be3c20a75e8547196378f54ffab5f"
          }
        ],
        "address": "0x1a45675bd474c8e3056a7dbd19e738d7849c0d26"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
