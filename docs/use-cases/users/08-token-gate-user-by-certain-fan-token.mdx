# Token Gate User By Certain Creator Coin

<Header
  useCase="build token gate feature to limit access to a certain Creator Coin holders"
  apiName="Moxie Protocol Subgraph"
/>

You can either use the subgraph APIs or Airstack API to build Creator Coin gating for your app/project.

# Method #1: Airstack API

Using the Airstack `MoxieUserPortolio` API, you can simply provide the user FID and the designated Creator Coin to check their holdings, both staked and non-staked in the Moxie Power Staking contract.

# Method #2: Subgraphs

:::info[Include User's Vesting Addresses]

Moxie protocol users have Moxie token currently vesting in their vesting contract. A huge portion of them use these to bid on auctions and buy/sell Creator Coins on the Moxie protocol.

Therefore, it is important that you include the user's vesting addresses in the query when building token gate feature to limit access to a certain token holders. To **get user's vesting contract addresses**, click [**here**](../vesting/01-get-users-vesting-contract-addresses.mdx).

## Pre-requisites

<Prerequisites apiName="Moxie Protocol Subgraph" />

### Step 1: Add The API Query To Your Code

<AddQuery
  useCase="build token gate feature to limit access to a certain Creator Coin holders"
  subgraphLink={url.protocol_stats_subgraphs}
  query={`query MyQuery($userAddresses: [ID!], $fanTokenSymbol: String) {
  users(where: { id_in: $userAddresses }) {
    portfolio(where: { subjectToken_: { symbol: $fanTokenSymbol} }) {
      balance
    }
  }
}`}
  variable={`{
  "userAddresses": [
    "0x00d620def6ccb76c92dbfc87bc2bebab7637ec53"
  ],
  /**
   * There are 3 types of Creator Coins, here's how the symbol is formatted:
   * - USER -> fid:<fid>
   * - CHANNEL -> cid:<channel-id>
   * - NETWORK (Only for Farcaster) -> id:farcaster
   */
  "fanTokenSymbol": "cid:fitness"
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "portfolio": [
          {
            "balance": "10000000000000000000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
  customLogic={`console.log(
    // Check if the user has a balance greater than 0
    Number.parseInt(data?.users?.[0]?.portfolio?.[0]?.balance) > 0
  );`}
/>

### Step 2: Execute Your Code

<ExecuteCode
  response={`true // true if balance is greater than 0, otherwise false`}
  dataFetched="user's balance of a certain Creator Coin and use it to build token gate feature to limit access to a certain Creator Coin holders"
/>
