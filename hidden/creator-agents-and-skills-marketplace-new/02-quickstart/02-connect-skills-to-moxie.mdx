# Connect Your Skills to Moxie

Now that you've developed your Skills, it's time to connect your Skills to Moxie and register them to the Skills Marketplace.

This guide will walk you through each step to get your Skills successfully listed.

## Step 1: Add Your Skills to `skills.json`

First, open the `skills.json` file in the `registry/src` folder and add your Skills metadata.

During this step, you can rename your Skill, polish its description, or add a logo. Once youâ€™ve prepared all the metadata, follow the structure below:

```typescript
interface Skills {
  /**
   * Any UUID, must be unique; you can generate one at https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
   */
  pluginId: string;

  /**
   * Name of the Skills, matching package.json
   */
  name: string;

  /**
   * Version of the Skills, matching package.json
   */
  version: string;

  /**
   * Description of what the Skills can do
   */
  description: string;

  /**
   * Author/creator of the Skills (optional)
   */
  author?: string | null;

  /**
   * GitHub URL to your Skills folder under `/packages`
   */
  githubUrl: string;

  /**
   * URL to the logo.png file (400x400 px) in your Skills folder (optional)
   */
  imageUrl?: string | null;
}
```

A valid skills.json entry will look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "pluginId": "b5622f90-987e-51d1-bea9-5b1471bb9379",
    "name": "@moxie-protocol/plugin-moxie-balance",
    "version": "0.1.8+build.1",
    "author": null,
    "description": "A Skills for AI Agents that enables portfolio balance checking for Moxie users' connected wallets.",
    "githubUrl": "https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-plugin/tree/main/packages/plugin-moxie-balance",
    "imageUrl": "https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-plugin/tree/main/packages/plugin-moxie-balance/images/logo.png"
  }
]
```

## Step 2: Submit Request to Add Environment Variables (Optional)

If your Skills do not require any environment variables, you can skip this step.

If your Skills need environment variables for production, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/8hzDyCVKKLs4MkTEA) to request them from the Moxie team. The team will reach out via **Email** (support@airstack.xyz) or **Farcaster** (group chat).

## Step 3: Create a PR to `main` Branch

Lastly, create a new PR targeting the main branch. The Moxie team will review your submission and approve it if it meets the guidelines below:

1. You have tested the Skills locally with the agent and confirmed everything works.
2. Your Skills include a well-written README describing all actions, providers, evaluators, services, and clients.
3. You have added the new Skills metadata to `registry/src/skill.json`.
4. You have not made changes to any other parts of the repository beyond the new Skills folder.
5. (Optional) You have requested environment variables via [this form](https://forms.gle/8hzDyCVKKLs4MkTEA), if needed.
6. Your code does not transfer Moxie user's holdings to a fixed address.
7. Your code does not extract Moxie user's private information (e.g., wallet addresses, private keys).
8. Your code does not interact with unverified or unpublished smart contracts.
9. Any smart contracts your Skills interact with that also have liqudity or daily volume more than 100k USD must be audited.

Once your PR is approved and merged, congratulation! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully added your Skills to the Skills Marketplace where it's accessible for Moxie users to use.
